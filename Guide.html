    <h1>ADAPT YOGA</h1>
    <p>The Effects of Adaptive Yoga on Disabled people</p>

        
    <p>Yoga is an art and science that connects the mind, body, and spirit through the practice of physical postures (asana), partnered with the breath (pranayama), and meditation practices to improve health and promote personal transformation. Adaptive Yoga modifies these postures for persons with Multiple Sclerosis (abnormal hardening of body tissue), Parkinson’s Disease, stroke, and other neuromuscular conditions. The purpose of this study is to examine people with mobility impairments facing increased barriers to physical activity and to develop gameplay with different gestures of Adaptive Yoga that best fit, based on their disabilities & flexibility.</p>
        
    <p>Adaptive Yoga:</p>
        <p>Self-efficacy in behavioral science influences health behavior choices and effort and relates to health outcomes. It is proposed that an individual’s confidence in his or her yoga practice affects the likelihood of improved physical and mental health. The three main tools of yoga are body, breath, and mind. While various styles of yoga exist, one popular and influential style is yoga in the Krishnamacharya tradition (or Viniyoga). Basic descriptions of each yoga tool according to Krishnamacharya are:
        Body: Physical movements are coupled to breathing requiring practitioners to dual-task, which demands increased cognitive attention.
        Breath: Breathing exercises may also be performed without physical movement (called pranayama). Usually breathing is done deeply and slowly with experienced practitioners reducing respiratory rates substantially below resting (less than 6 breaths a minute).
        Mind: Meditation is the practice of focusing the mind in a single direction. The direction or object of focus varies based on the goal of the meditation practice. Objects of meditation may be within the body (e.g., breathing, thoughts, and body parts) or mind (e.g., thoughts or feelings), or external (e.g., images of nature). The ability to focus the mind is a skill that develops gradually over time from regular yoga practice. Physical movements of the body and breathing exercises are used to train the mind to focus and prepare for meditation. It also encourages individuals to practice with ease, without physical, breath, or mental strain.
        
        Furthermore, yoga helps individuals practice with strength and steadiness regarding movement, breath, and meditation. Yoga requires that each exercise encompass the dual qualities of ease and strength in body, breath, and mind while maintaining focus.</p>
        
       <p> Wheelchair disabled people:</p>
        <p>This study primarily focuses on Adaptive yoga for Wheelchair disabled people. World Health Organization and United Kingdom Government reports demonstrate the need for improved access to wheelchairs both locally and internationally. The use of health economics within this field is lacking. The provision of wheelchairs based on cost-effectiveness evidence is not currently possible. An estimated 770,000 children and young people under the age of 16 in the UK living with a disability. Several UK government and not-for-profit organizations (NFPO) reports have found that wheelchair services for children and young people in the UK need improvement to meet service user needs. There are some distinct health challenges related to the physical effects of long-term wheelchair use, such as shoulder overuse injuries, skin breakdown, and urinary tract disorders. Wheelchair users may also encounter barriers to accessing preventive health care and getting sufficient physical activity. It is likely to have wide-ranging impacts on the overall health of people who use wheeled mobility devices. Physical activity interventions include balance, falls, transfers, self-efficacy in self-ambulation, depression, physical fitness, and cardiovascular health. Interventions to increase physical activity could also play a role in improving the preventive health care of people who rely on wheeled mobility devices, as well as increasing their workforce participation, independence, and quality of life.
        
        The development of health economics methodologies based on a social model of health would promote a holistic evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for disabled people. Adaptive yoga can be beneficial for individuals with disabilities or chronic health conditions through both physical postures and breathwork. Each pose can be modified or adapted to meet the needs of the student. Yoga asanas can be performed while seated in a chair or wheelchair. Chair Yoga: The Sitting Mountain Series by Voelker-Binder was developed for individuals with arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, or stroke.
        
        The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans highlight the need for increased physical activity in the population living with disability and recommend a mix of strength training and aerobic exercise to promote wellness and prevent disease. This is where exactly Adaptive Yoga helps every individual to do their physical exercises by modifying the exact gesture in accordance to the physical condition & flexibility of the disabled people by using properties like blankets, straps, and chairs to make the poses open to more people.</p>
